In the RDL specification for RS2005 and 2008, almost every report item can be extended by adding custom properties. Currently, Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services 2005 and 2008 supports three such properties:

- Table of contents, list of tables or figures.
- Line arrows.
- Footnote/endnote.

Find out how to use them in the [Expand Report Items Properties](/pdf/reportingservices/expand-report-items-properties-html/) article.
