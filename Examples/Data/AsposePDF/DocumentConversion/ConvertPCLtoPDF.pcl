This page demonstrates the various ways you can provide text data for indexing,
bursting, routing, filenaming, bookmarking or any other purpose during a 
PCL transformation by PCLXForm using it's script programming language. 


To see what the PCL code looks like, run this file through the PCLCodes.exe 
program for a PCL to readable text dump of the file.


																	   

(s0p3b10h12VExternal File Method:(s0p0b10h12V  PCLXForm can extract whatever text you place in 
an external file.  A script can parse the external file while transforming the
PCL and utilize the extracted text, images, barcodes, etc. 





(s0p3b10h12VBanner Page Method:(s0p0b10h12V  PCLXForm can extract whatever text you place on a 
banner page inserted into the printstream.  It can then skip over the
inserted banner page and use the information for indexing, bursting, 
routing, filenaming or bookmarkings.

(s0p3b10h12VReverse Text Method:(s0p0b10h12V  PCLXForm can find the text hidden as reverse text.
To be sure the text is not "scrambled" by the latest Windows printer drivers
you should use the printer resident 12pt Courier font for the hidden text.
The Reverse Text code is just above this text.

(s0p3b10h12VConfidential PCL ID Method:(s0p0b10h12V  PCLXForm and PTC32.DLL can detect the presense of
this undocumented comment PCL escape code of a unique number that is not printed
by the printer. 


This code is assigned by PageTech and is mainly used to restrict the use of
our products for just those PCL files that contain this unique 5-digit number
code on the first page of each print stream.  We can generate the RUNCODE to 
shutdown the PTC32.DLL if the correct code is not detected.
The Confidential PCL ID code is just above this sentence.

(s0p3b10h12VColor Text Method:(s0p0b10h12V  When we re-activate support color text commands in 
PTC32.DLL, you will be able to hide text by setting the color to white.
